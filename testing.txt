1.	DESCRIPTION	:	Sanity testing by failure free scenario with 3 replicas and fault tolerance(t) as 1.
	CONFIGFILES	:	no_failure_t1_c3.txt
	OTHER 		:	Client timeout value is taken as 100 ms, so as to avoid premature timeout.
	OUTCOME 	:	PASS

2.	DESCRIPTION	:	Sanity testing by failure free scenario with 3 replicas and fault tolerance(t) as 2.
	CONFIGFILES	:	no_failure_t2_c3.txt

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.	DESCRIPTION	:	Testing retransmission by client and handling of the same by replicas by setting timers, by maiking TAIL sleep before sending response to client.
	CONFIGFILES	:	sleep_tail_reply_t1_c2.txt
	OTHER 		:	sleep_before_send = 4 (in secs) is set in config file to inject this failure. Client Timeout value is kept reasonably low for result shuttle not to reach all nodes.

	OTHER 		:	10 Clients with 5 operations each; t=2 configured for moderate replica side workload.
	OUTCOME 	:	PASS

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
